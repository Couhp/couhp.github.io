A monument in the hack and slash dark dungeon roguelike, Dead Cells made a huge splash when it launched on PC back in 2017. 

Think of a game. Now disregard its narrative, level design, puzzles, and visual design. Would the simple act of moving around and interacting with that game’s world still be fun? The answer is yes for Dead Cells, that’s a perfect ‘game feel’ in action. It’s a rare quality, but Dead Cells made it.

You switch after every death between the three colored builds. Make sure you spend the money to upgrade your current equipment when available. Most importantly you need to keep rerolling your stats and mutations to synergize. As in increasing damage on bleeding enemies or critical hit damage on frozen enemies. Your arsenal, no matter the build, needs to match affixes as much as possible.

ENYO is a game from `Arnold Rauers`, a big name in mobile game industry for Turn-Based Strategy Games.

Grab your hook & shield and descent as Enyo, the greek goddess of war, into an ever changing labyrinth to recover 3 legendary artifacts.

ENYO's gameplay is based on the idea of indirect combat. Enemies can only be defeated by pushing or pulling them into burning lava pits or deadly spiked walls.

ENYO's original prototype was made for the 7 day roguelike challenge 2016 as Hook & Shield. The game evolves around the idea of indirect combat. Enemies can't be attack directly and can only be defeated by pushing or pulling them into lava or spiked walls. This way the player is forced to use clever tactical positioning to remove enemies and descent through the 10 levels.
ENYO is based on greek mythology where the figure Enyo, the greek goddess of war, descents into an ever changing labyrinth to recover 3 legendary artifacts.
